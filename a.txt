% Constants 
mic_distance = 0.1;          % Distance between microphones in meters 
sampling_rate = 44100;       % Sampling rate in Hz 
speed_of_sound = 343;        % Speed of sound in m/s 

% Simulate or load the gunshot signal received by three microphones 
% Synthetic signal example with delays 
mic1_signal = randn(1, 1000); % Synthetic noise + gunshot signal 
mic2_signal = circshift(mic1_signal, [0, 5]);  % Delay of 5 samples 
mic3_signal = circshift(mic1_signal, [0, 10]); % Delay of 10 samples 

% Cross-correlation between mic1 and mic2, mic1 and mic3 
[corr12, lags12] = xcorr(mic1_signal, mic2_signal); 
[corr13, lags13] = xcorr(mic1_signal, mic3_signal); 

% Find the lag (delay) corresponding to the maximum cross-correlation 
[~, idx12] = max(corr12); 
[~, idx13] = max(corr13); 
delay12 = lags12(idx12); 
delay13 = lags13(idx13); 

% Calculate time delays in seconds 
time_delay12 = delay12 / sampling_rate; 
time_delay13 = delay13 / sampling_rate; 

% Use TDOA to estimate angle of arrival 
% Assuming microphones are aligned along the x-axis 
angle1 = asind((time_delay12 * speed_of_sound) / mic_distance); 
angle2 = asind((time_delay13 * speed_of_sound) / (2 * mic_distance)); 

% Final estimated angle (average of both calculations) 
estimated_angle = (angle1 + angle2) / 2;
