Assumptions:

1. Microphone Data: Data from six omnidirectional microphones are available as digital signals from an ADC.
2. Clock and Reset: A system clock and reset signal are provided.
3. Threshold: A fixed threshold value is used to detect gunshot events.
4. Simplified Filtering and Detection: For simplicity, the code uses a basic threshold-based detection method.









Creating a Verilog implementation for an FPGA-based gunshot detection and localization system involves several components, such as handling ADC input, filtering, and time difference of arrival (TDOA) calculations for sound localization.
