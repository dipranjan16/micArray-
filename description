This FPGA-based gunshot detection and localization system uses six omnidirectional microphones to capture sound from all directions. The analog signals from the microphones are converted to digital form via an ADC, then fed into the FPGA. Inside the FPGA, each channel is filtered using a bandpass filter centered around 3 kHz to isolate gunshot sounds. A sound classification algorithm distinguishes gunshots from other noises, while a time difference of arrival (TDOA) method determines the direction of the gunshot. The result is displayed on a graphical LCD, providing real-time alerts and directional information to enhance troop safety.
